# Court Booking Platform — Implementation Phases

A phased approach to design and implementation, where each phase delivers a working, deployable increment. Each phase gets its own spec (design + tasks) created when ready to start.

Dependencies flow downward — later phases build on earlier ones.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation & Infrastructure

**Target repos:** `court-booking-infrastructure`, `court-booking-platform-service`, `court-booking-transaction-service`, `court-booking-common`

**Scope:**
- Terraform modules for DigitalOcean (DOKS, Managed PostgreSQL + PostGIS, Managed Redis, Spaces, Container Registry, VPC, Load Balancer, DNS)
- Kubernetes manifests, NGINX Ingress Controller, namespace setup (dev/test/staging/production)
- CI/CD pipelines in GitHub Actions for both services (build, test, scan with Trivy, push to DOCR, deploy)
- Docker Compose for local development (PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka)
- Database schema migrations (Flyway) — initial tables for both platform and transaction schemas
- Shared common library setup (`court-booking-common`) with Maven/GitHub Packages
- Spring Boot project scaffolding for both services (profiles, actuator health endpoints)
- External Secrets Operator / Sealed Secrets for secret management

**Deliverable:** Both services running on DOKS (empty but healthy), CI/CD green, local dev environment working.

## Phase 2 — Auth & User Management (Platform Service)

**Target repos:** `court-booking-platform-service`

**Requirements covered:** Req 1 (full)

**Scope:**
- OAuth registration and login (Google, Facebook, Apple)

- Biometric authentication flow (secure enclave refresh token storage)
- Role-based access control: CUSTOMER, COURT_OWNER, SUPPORT_AGENT, PLATFORM_ADMIN
- User profile CRUD (name, email, phone, language)
- Account deletion with GDPR compliance (anonymization, future booking cancellation)
- Concurrent session management (max 5 devices)
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- OAuth provider linking/unlinking

**Deliverable:** Users can register, login, manage profiles, and receive proper JWT tokens. Auth is the foundation for everything else.

Phase 2 ────────────►
Phase 3   ────────────────►
Phase 4        ────────────────►
Phase 5             ──────────────►

Phase 10                                    ──────────────►
```

## Spec Creation Strategy

For each phase:
1. Create a dedicated spec directory: `.kiro/specs/{phase-name}/`
2. Generate `requirements.md` (scoped to that phase's requirements from the master requirements doc)
3. Generate `design.md` (detailed technical design for that phase)
4. Generate `tasks.md` (implementation task list with property-based tests)
5. Execute tasks
6. Review and validate before moving to next phase
